I'm a PhD student at Inria Saclay and INSA CVL, in the team PETSCRAFT. My research topic is Privacy-Enhancing Technologies with Time Series data. I did my master (engineering degree) at INSA de Rennes, majored in Computer Science (with double degree in master of research). I had my baccalaureate in China, Beijing.
